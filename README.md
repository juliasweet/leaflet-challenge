Leaflet homework for DVA bootcamp

As usual, much gratitude goes to Brent Hillen, who really helped me unmuddle my code. I had put things in an order that wasn't quite ideal, and he helped me figure out how to improve it. 

Because of his help, I was able to devote some more time to adding additional styling.
